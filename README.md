# CornHub
CornHub is a side project I made for the benefit of humanity and I believe it is my duty to allow everyone at home to have their own CornHub running on their own server.

CornHub is a CORNpilation of truly aMAIZing puctures of sCORNtily clad corns.

Sorry about that. The corn puns are unCORNtrollable.

Alright I'm done.

I used the Flask framework in Python to get this working and built a Docker image to run it.

## Running CornHub
Just run one command to get CornHub running:

`$ docker run -d -p 80:5000 connorswislow/cornhub:latest`
