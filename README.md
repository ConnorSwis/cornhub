# Cornhub
Cornhub is a side project I made for the benefit of humanity and I believe it is my duty to allow everyone at home to have their own Cornhub running on their own server.

Cornhub is a CORNpilation of truly aMAIZing puctures of sCORNtily clad corns.

Sorry about that. The corn puns are unCORNtrollable.

Alright I'm done.

I used the Flask framework in Python to get this working and built a Docker image to run it.


## Running Cornhub
Just run one command to get Cornhub running:

`$ docker run -d -p 80:5000 connorswislow/cornhub:latest`
